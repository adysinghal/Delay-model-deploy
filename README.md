# Shipment Delay Prediction
This project aims to predict shipment delays by analyzing and pre-processing extensive data entries and implementing machine learning models. By leveraging Python libraries and machine learning algorithms, we achieve significant accuracy in estimating delivery dates and predicting delays based on courier status codes.

## Features
* Data Analysis and Pre-processing: Utilized pandas and numpy to handle and pre-process over 200,000 data entries.
* Statistical Modeling: Developed a statistical model that calculates estimated delivery dates with a 78% accuracy rate.
* Machine Learning: Implemented a machine learning model using XGBoost, achieving an 81% accuracy in predicting shipment delays based on status codes from the courier company’s API.
* Web Hosting: The project is hosted online, allowing for easy access and interaction. Check it out at https://delay-prediction.streamlit.app/
